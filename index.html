        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a full stack web developer, with forty years coding experience in
          a variety of languages and on several platforms. I am currently
          enrolled in
          <a href="#">Columbia Engineering's Coding Bootcamp</a>

        <h3>Week 1: Refactoring</h3>
        <p>
          This exercise replaced numerous div elements with semantic html, and
          added alt text to images. The stylesheet was cleaned up and
          simplified.

          <h3>Week 2: My Portfolio</h3>
          <p>This exercise challenged me to create a Portfolio page, listing my projects and providing some information about me and directions on how to contact me.</p>

            <h3>Real Property Assessment System</h3>
            <p>New York State has 1990's era client/server software called RPS (Real Property System) in use by about 95% of assessing units in the state. The state has been struggling to update it for modern times. My personal belief is that it should be an open-source project.</p>
