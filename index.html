      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to be a full stack web developer. I have forty years coding
        experience in a variety of languages and on several platforms. I am
        currently enrolled in
        <a href="#">Columbia Engineering's Coding Bootcamp</a>
        to learn the latest techniques in development.

        <h3>Week 1: Refactoring</h3>
        <p>
          This exercise replaced div elements with semantic html, and
          added alt text to images. The stylesheet was cleaned up and
          simplified. I added comments to both the html and css files to help
          future developers maintain the code.

          to contact me.

        <h3>Real Property Assessment System</h3>
        <p>
          New York State has 1990's era client/server software called RPS (Real
          Property System) in use by about 95% of approximately 1,200 assessing
          units in the state. The state has been struggling to update it for
          modern times. My personal belief is that it should be an open-source
          project.
