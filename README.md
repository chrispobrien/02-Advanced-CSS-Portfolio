# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
Week 2 of Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp has us creating a personal Portfolio page using Advanced CSS and particularly flex elements. This makes the page readable and friendly to mobile users, which constitute up to 70% of visitors.

For the published page, please visit my Github pages site: [https://chrispobrien.gibthub.io/02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio/]

Objectives include:


```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

* For this homework exercise, we begin with a blank page. However, there was an animated gif provided to show the application's appearance and functionality.
* I think we are intended to make a functional page like the animated gif.
* I used flexbox and media queries to create a responsive design
* All images besides my photo are public domain, downloaded from Pixnio.com.

## Installation

Using git, issue the command:

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/chrispobrien/02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio.git
~~~

This will create the folder 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio within which you will find index.html, this README.md file, and an assets folder containing a css folder for one stylesheet, style.css, and an images folder containing the images that appear on this page.

## Usage

Move or copy the contents of the folder into your web server's folder.
